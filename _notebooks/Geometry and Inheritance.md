# Inheritance Example: 2D Geometry

The classes below represent simple 2D shapes.  Currently the only supported functionality is `get_area`, but more could be added.


```python

            its width and height.

            y1: y-coordinate of the upper left corner of the rectangle

1.  Simplify the code above using inheritance.  You can either cut-and-paste the code  and modify it in the cell below, or modify the original code.

Hint 1: you will want to modify the `__init__` methods to invoke the `__init__` methods of the super class.  To do so, you can use the following code in your `__init__` method.

```python
# argument1 and argument2 would be passed to the super class __init__ method
super().__init__(argument1, argument2)   
```

Hint 2: think about the `get_area` function for each of the classes, can they be simplified using inheritance?


```python

```

<ol start="2">
<li>Create a right triangle class (make sure to use inheritance!)</li>
</ol>


```python

```

<ol start="3">
<li>Add a function called `get_hypotenuse_length` to your right triangle class.</li>
</ol>


```python

```
