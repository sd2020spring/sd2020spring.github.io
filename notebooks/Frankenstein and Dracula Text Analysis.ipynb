    "## Main Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to analyze the sentences in Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\" and Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein.\"  I'm going to take a machine learning approach where I attempt to build a model that uses individual words in a particular sentence taken from one of the two works, and then attempts to predict which of the two works it came from.  While there is nothing inherently useful (at least in this case) about being able to predict which work a sentence came from, by examining the way the model solves the problem we can learn a little bit about each of the two works."

After loading each work as a string, I used NTLK's sentence tokenizer to chop up each string into sentences (you could do a rough approximation of this by splitting your string on periods, but the NLTK tokenizer is more advanced, e.g., it doesn't get fooled by abbreviations like Ms. or Mr.)."

    "## Vectorize the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create a model to automatically categorize sentences as being from Dracula or Frankenstein, we first need to vectorize our data.  The process of vectorization will take the data strings that represent each sentence and convert them into a vector of numbers.  The reason that we are doing this is that there are many more examples of machine learning models that can handle numerical data than string data, so we are converting our data from a less usable to a more usable format.\n",
    "\n",
    "The particular method we are going to be using to vectorize our data is called [tf-idf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf).  A full explanation of this is beyond the scope of this notebook, but the basic idea is to convert each sentence into a vector where each element of the resulting vector indicates how prominently a particular word factors in that sentence.  In these two texts it turns out there are 12,712 unique words.  Therefore, each sentence is represented as a 12,712 dimensional vector.  However, Since most words don't occur at all in a particular sentence, most of these entries are 0.\n",

    "\n",
    "Before we can do machine learning, we need to do a few things.  The first thing is that we have to tell the machine learning algorithm what task we want it to solve.  We do this by giving it a bunch of vectors and corresponding labels.  The vectors in this case will be the vectorized sentences (i.e. converted into tf-idf features), and the labels will correspond to a 1 if the sentence came from Dracula and a 0 if it came from Frankenstein (which text gets a 1 versus a 0 is arbitrary).\n",

We will use the training set to construct our model (recall that the model's job will be to predict whether a sentence is from Dracula or Frankenstein) and we will use the testing set to evaluate how well the model learned on the training set actually works on new data.  We don't want to just test the model on the training set, because that would give us an overinflated sence of how well the model is doing."

The basic idea is that our model will fit a set of weights over each entry of the input vectors (remember, each entry in the vector corresponds to a particular word).  Each weight will tell us to what degree a particular word is associated with either Frankenstein or Dracula.  If the weight is very positive, this means that the corresponding word is associated with the novel Dracula.  If the weight is very negative, this means that the corresponding word is associated with the novel Frankenstein.  As a side note, the only reason taht positive corresponds to Dracula and negative corresponds to Frankenstein is that when we setup the task we arbitrarily assigned a \"1\" to sentences from Dracula and a \"0\" to sentences from Frankenstein.\n",
