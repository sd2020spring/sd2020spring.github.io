    "#  Classes and Inheritance Worksheet\n",
    "\n",
    "This worksheet is designed to provide students with an opportunity to create classes in Python in a context that is familiar. Many college courses involve working on project teams. Students are sometimes given a say in choosing project partners. Below, you'll work on writing code that can, in theory, help students discover partners that might be good to work with, based on criteria that gets defined and refined throughout the exercises below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each section has some explanatory language and an exercise to complete. You'll have space for you to try out your solutions. Readings that might be useful to (re)visit as you do this worksheet are chapters 15 through 18 in the Think Python 2nd Edition book. Tutorials at realpython.com tend to be very readable."

For the following exercises, we will establish that a reasonable criterion is that a student who brings perspectives to project teams that differ from other partners is a good fit. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will define a method called different_perspective(). This method will look at a potential partner and return True if that person does not have the exact same experience as the student seeking a partner does.

    "### Representing class structures\n",
    "\n",
    "The way that you set up classes is usually a matter of taste. There are tradeoffs with each approach - setting up a relationship that is one of the following options:\n",
    "1) A class \"is a\" more specific version of another class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) A class \"has a\" class or object that forms a part of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first relationship is inheritance, as in \"a Software Design student is a college student.\" The second relationship is composition, as in \"a university has college students.\" When documenting these relationships in text or images, it is important to specify whether one or many instances of a given class are expected.\n",

    "\n",
    "As we moved through this worksheet, the example code began using the CollegeStudent class to make instances of students and the code ended up instantiating CollegeStudent subclasses mostly. To override methods of the subclasses make the most sense to use, so that students who are not on top of it get their concern notes sent to the right places. It helps to make a parent class that has base functions for all of the children to adopt or override. There's a way to signal to anyone reading code that a class is made to be more of a template for others. An Abstract Base Class in Python gives a construct for declaring that a class should not be initialized itself, in favor of its subclasses making up all of the instances.\n",
