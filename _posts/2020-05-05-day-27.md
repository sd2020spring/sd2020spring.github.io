Studio Time for Day 27 - videos


## Final work deadline
  * Everything is due Thursday night (and then you are almost done with SoftDes)
    * we cannot accept any work (current or make-up assignment) after Friday 5/8 and there are no exceptions per Olin policy
  * Please let us know how Software Design might improve moving forward
    * fill out [this survey](https://forms.gle/TpHJYSL7fBXq2fqP7) by Friday at 5PM EST to make sure that your opinions are heard


## For Friday
  * Friday's class is a celebration
  * Depth teams will have time to share their screens to show what they've been cooking up (optional)
    * Depth teams: please answer the two questions that are a part of [this assignment](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1804687/assignments/15084637) by Thursday 5/7 noon EST
      * 1) YES! We want to talk about and/or demo our project during the final virtual session, or
      * 2) NO! It's been fun, but we're done - we shan't share about our project during the final session.
  * Faculty will give Course Assistants awards, such as:
    * The Zoom Unicorn - for the most unique Zoom backgrounds used
    * The Announcer Award - for the most class announcements sent
    * The Infinite Feedback Award - for the most characters typed in comments to students
    * we'll definitely make up some of the spot too


## Class photo Backdrop Challenge
  * We'll take at least 2 class photos for posterity (a SoftDes tradition)
    * we usually capture a class photo during the last session - see [last year's photo](https://photos.app.goo.gl/4RAbiHj4N2Yfs6uu6)
    * because we're all in little video squares this year, we'd like to use interesting virtual backgrounds as a class if possible
      * see what Olin Baha did in a Faculty + Staff thank you video - [baha background example](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i-y_oqX6bz0WnxNyiMZBVOcgI4tJvbNW/view?usp=sharing)
      * check out this example [SoftDes backdrop for inspiration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tqk3-MpcHIh3DaA_7u8JyBUtdjzGOgBB/view?usp=sharing)
      * submit your own using the optional [Canvas assignment](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1804687/assignments/15083671) for the Zoom class photo backdrop challenge
  * The winning backdrops will be decided during the teaching team's Thursday lunch meeting
    * we will unveil the final decisions during Friday's class
    * we're also likely to share funny stories about the selection process
    * we also might make a "people's choice" winner and take an extra photo


## Capturing videos
If you would like to create a video of a game or interactive project that you're working on, we have some [guidance on our class page](https://sd2020spring.github.io/resources/#demo-videos).
  * videos are great for embedding dynamic footage into your project websites
  * they can also be ads
    * explaining your goals
    * showing your work in action
    * introduce the problem domain, establishing why what you're working on is interesting
  * There are two main routes you can take to create this presentation:
    * video with audio narration
    * "silent film" with title cards and/or text overlay explanations
  * There are recipes to help you accomplish this technically on the [resources page](/resources/#demo-videos)
  * we encourage you to storyboard or script your draft before shooting
    * you may have a website MVP already that can guide the storyboard
  * be careful of how you present yourself and your work (in videos of photos including humans / voices)
    * playful is a tone that can work well if used thoughtfully
      * think about what is socially appropriate for different audiences
        * guardians, peers, employers, profs, clergy, neighborhood superheroes etc
