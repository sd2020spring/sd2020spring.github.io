  * everything is due Thursday night!
  * Please let us know how Software Design might improve moving forward
    * fill out [this survey](http://softdes.olin.edu) by Friday at 5PM to make sure that your opinions are heard

## For Friday
  * Friday's class is a celebration
  * Depth teams will have time to share their screens to show what they've been cooking up (optional)
  * We'll give Course Assistants awards
  * We'll take at least 2 class photos for posterity
    * we usually capture a class photo during the last session
    * Because we're all in little squares this year, we'd like to use interesting virtual backgrounds as a class if possible
      * see what Olin Baha did in a Faculty + Staff thank you video [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i-y_oqX6bz0WnxNyiMZBVOcgI4tJvbNW/view?usp=sharing)
      * check out this example backdrop for inspiration [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tqk3-MpcHIh3DaA_7u8JyBUtdjzGOgBB/view?usp=sharing)
      * submit your own using the optional Canvas assignment for the Zoom class photo

## Capturing videos
If you would like to create a video of a game or interactive project that you're working on, we have some [guidance on our class page](https://sd2020spring.github.io/resources/#demo-videos).
  * videos are great for embedding dynamic footage into your project websites
  * they can also be ads
    * explaining your goals
    * showing your work in action
    * introduce the problem domain, establishing why what you're working on is interesting
  * There are two main routes you can take to create this presentation:
    * video with audio narration
    * "silent film" with title cards and/or text overlay explanations
  * There are recipes to help you accomplish this technically on the [resources page](/resources/#demo-videos)
  * we encourage you to storyboard or script your draft before shooting
    * you may have a website MVP already that can guide the storyboard
  * be careful of how you present yourself and your work (in videos of photos including humans / voices)
    * playful is a tone that can work well if used thoughtfully
      * think about what is socially appropriate for different audiences
        * guardians, peers, employers, profs, clergy, neighborhood superheroes etc
