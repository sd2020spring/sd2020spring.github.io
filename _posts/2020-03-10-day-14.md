## Today

* Check that your MP3 slide includes your name!
* Reminder: Toolbox 2 due Friday
* MP4 kick-off
* Model-View-Controller pattern introduction


## MP4: Interactive Programming

Sit with your partner and discuss the issues raised in the ["Getting Started"](/assignments/mini-project-4-interactive-visualization#getting-started) section.
Bring course staff into your conversation as desired.

After you've come to a shared understanding, start generating project ideas and working on your written proposal (due before 9:00 AM tomorrow as a Canvas submission).

If your partner was unable to make it to today's class session, you will set up and host the repo from your account.
The proposal that you add to the repo and submit a link for on canvas can include up to three ideas for a project. Submitting more than one idea can get you instructor feedback on more than one possible MP4 direction. You can then discuss these possible directions with your partner when they are able to meet. If possible, this meeting should happen before Friday's class.


## Model-View-Controller (MVC) brief intro
We are going to do a brief exercise to introduce the Model View Controller concept briefly today,
so that partners can think about how well this framework might lend itself to one or more of the MP4 ideas brainstormed today.

Model-View-Controller is what is known as a [software design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern).

> In [software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering), a [design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern) is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. A design pattern is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

The Model-View-Controller design pattern (or MVC for short) is an extremely useful design pattern for a number of applications.  The most common places that it shows up are graphical user interfaces and web applications.  Most importantly it is ideally suited to the projects that you all will be doing for this mini-project.  Here is a figure that shows the basic principles of the MVC design pattern.

> * A controller can send commands to the model to update the model's state (e.g. editing a document). It can also send commands to its associated view to change the view's presentation of the model (e.g. by scrolling through a document).
> * A model stores data that is retrieved according to commands from the controller and displayed in the view.
> * A view generates an output presentation to the user based on changes in the model.

This decomposition has a number of extremely nice properties.  At the highest level, the pattern allows for the writing of loosely coupled and highly modular code.  This allows various components to be swapped out with minimal changes to the overall program.
We'll look at an example program using the MVC pattern in a future class (likely Friday).


## A possible MVC for Pac-Man
From the assignment page, we can think through an example of how the classic game, Pac-Man, could be broken into an MVC framework.

Here are the classes and the functions that you might use to implement a Pac-Man clone:

* `Model`: encodes the overall game state of the Pac-Man game (including level, position of pellets, position of Pac-Man and ghosts, etc.)
  * Provides an interface to the Controller to respond appropriately to user commands
  * Handles collisions between Pac-Man and ghosts as well as Pac-Man and small and large pellets
* `PacMan`: represents the player's avatar in the game (a part of the model)
  * Provides an interface to respond to player actions as communicated by the controller (e.g. Pac-Man's next move)
* `Ghost`: represents a ghost in the game (a part of the model)
* `Small pellet`: represents a small pellet in the game (a part of the model)
* `Large pellet`: represents a large pellet in the game (a part of the model)
* `Controller`: handles commands from the user and manipulates the model appropriately
* `PyGameView`: draws the game state encoded by the Model to a pygame window

There are many ways to implement Model-View-Controller, so this is not the
only way to operationalize Model-View-Controller in the context of Pac-Man.
Remember, this is not the only way to structure your object-oriented design (code that uses classes),
but we hope it will be helpful at least as a jumping off point.


## Other possible MVCs
With your partner, revisit one of the project ideas that you discussed. Try to think about what a model of that project might contain.
What would be some of the controls in a controller class? The teaching team will be available throughout the studio time to ask questions about this.
