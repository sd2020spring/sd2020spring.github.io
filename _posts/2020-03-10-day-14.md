## Today

* Check that your [MP3
  slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NfbufS7pLlBDdmlahqW2iY2g8HT6YbkQPEnicIFFCKc/edit?usp=sharing) includes your name!
* Reminder: Toolbox 2 due Friday
* MP4 kick-off
* Model-View-Controller pattern introduction


## MP4: Interactive Programming

Sit with your partner and discuss the issues raised in the ["Getting Started"](/assignments/mini-project-4-interactive-visualization#getting-started) section.
Bring course staff into your conversation as desired.

After you've come to a shared understanding, start generating project ideas and working on your written proposal (due at 9:00 AM tomorrow as a Canvas submission).

If your partner was unable to make it to today's class session, you will set up and host the repo from your account.
The proposal that you add to the repo and submit a link for on canvas can include up to three ideas for a project. Submitting more than one idea can get you instructor feedback on more than one possible MP4 direction. You can then discuss these possible directions with your partner when they are able to meet. If possible, this meeting should happen before Friday's class.


## The Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern

Throughout this course, there are implementation techniques that you have
learned and applied in different contexts. For example, you have created and
iterated over a list to do things like find a maximum value, process a series of
files, or to read and write a dictionary. Many implementation tasks often
decompose into sub-problems that can often be solved by applying a pattern you
have seen before.

Similarly, when thinking about the design of larger programs, there are patterns
that you can learn to recognize and apply. As this description would suggest, we
call these [design
patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern). The world of
object-oriented programming uses design patterns quite often, and these patterns
often provide helpful templates to structure your classes and their methods.

In interactive software and user interface design, the
[Model-View-Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_view_controller)
(MVC) pattern is common. In short, MVC separates the design of a system into
three components:

* The *model* is a representation of the system. More specifically, the model
  represents the *state* of a system at a particular point in time, and contains
  all of the data of the system that can be read or written.
* The *view* is a representation of the model, and is particularly oriented
  towards *the user*. The view includes functionality to process and show the
  state of the system in a way that is suitable for the end user.
* The *controller* is the way by which the user can change the system, or more
  specifically, the model that represents the system. Any action the user wants
  to perform on the system goes through the controller.

Here is a graphical representation of the MVC components and their interactions
with the user:

When done well, MVC makes it easy to reason about what can change the state of
the system (the controller) and what can read the state of the system (the
view). The relatively intuitive separation of tasks also makes the design
*modular*: components can be easily swapped out for others that do a similar
task. For example, two different views and controllers can be used to interact
with the same system model, one on a desktop and one on a phone or tablet.

Because this mini-project focuses on interactive computing, we think the MVC
pattern is particularly well-suited for your tasks, and we'd like you to spend
some time practicing designing software that follows this pattern.

To help get you started, here's an example of how MVC could be used for a code
editor, like Atom:

* The model contains things like what directory the editor is in, what files are
  currently open, what line the cursor is on, which files have unsaved changes,
  what plugins are installed, and any configuration settings the user has.
* The view contains functions to show keywords like `for`, `def`, and `import`
  (in Python) in specific colors, to make the cursor blink at a certain rate,
  display the font of the editor, etc.
* The controller takes input from the user, which includes code, comments, and
  key sequences (like `Ctrl-S` to save a file). It turns these keypresses into
  actions by calling functions that change the model state, such as moving the
  cursor up one line if the user presses the Up Arrow key.

It's important to remember that design patterns are about the structure, and may
leave some details unclear. For example, in the above design, should the font be
part of the model or the view? It depends, and you could make a well-reasoned
case for either one.

Now, you can try coming up with a similar design for an interactive graphical
game.

## MVC Pac-Man

Take a few minutes to think about how the game Pac-Man could be designed
according to the MVC pattern. What would the model, view, and controller contain
or do?

Once you have answered these questions, try to translate that design into
classes, functions, and variables in Python. Try not to look ahead until you've
gotten the chance to write your thoughts down.

Here are some classes that we came up with that you might use to implement a
Pac-Man clone:

* `Model`: encodes the overall game state of the Pac-Man game (including level, position of pellets, position of Pac-Man and ghosts, etc.)
  * Provides an interface to the Controller to respond appropriately to user commands
  * Handles collisions between Pac-Man and ghosts as well as Pac-Man and small and large pellets
* `PacMan`: represents the player's avatar in the game (a part of the model)
  * Provides an interface to respond to player actions as communicated by the controller (e.g. Pac-Man's next move)
* `Ghost`: represents a ghost in the game (a part of the model)
* `Small pellet`: represents a small pellet in the game (a part of the model)
* `Large pellet`: represents a large pellet in the game (a part of the model)
* `Controller`: handles commands from the user and manipulates the model appropriately
* `PyGameView`: draws the game state encoded by the Model to a pygame window

(The last class in the above list is specific to a certain Python library that
follows this framework.)

There are many ways to implement Model-View-Controller, so this is not the only
way to operationalize Model-View-Controller in the context of Pac-Man. Remember,
this is not the only way to structure your object-oriented design (code that
uses classes), but we hope it will be helpful at least as a jumping off point.

## Other possible MVCs
With your partner, revisit one of the project ideas that you discussed. Try to think about what a model of that project might contain.
What would be some of the controls in a controller class? The teaching team will be available throughout the studio time to ask questions about this.
