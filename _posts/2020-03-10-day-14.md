## For next time
* Check that your MP3 slide includes your name! The Text Mining Show kicks off Friday's class
* Reminder: Toolbox 2 due Friday


## Today
* MP3 survey
* MP4 kick-off
* Model-View-Controller pattern introduction
* Resolving git merge conflicts


## MP3 survey
We used the results of previous surveys to form MP4 partner pairs for today.
We'll use the results of this post-MP3 survey to respond to your feedback as best we can on a rolling basis and when we form  Final Project Teams. When you are done with MP3, and have had a moment to sleep (we know that our assignments keep rolling, but we do expect that you know when to call it a night), please fill out the [Post-MP3 survey](https://forms.gle/TTH9N9W1xPZQLcgP6).



## MP4: Interactive Programming
See who you are partnered with on this [MP4 partner and studio list](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YNpesdPl0CsBq-sOY4cmEAfweoBnP14Q/view?usp=sharing). Take a moment to find the partner(s) and sit with them for the rest of this class - all in AC326 today, but in the studio listed after Spring Break.

With your partner(s), discuss the issues raised in the ["Getting Started"](/assignments/mini-project-4-interactive-visualization#getting-started) section. Bring course staff into your conversation as desired.

After you've come to a shared understanding, start generating project ideas and working on your written proposal (due before 9:00 AM tomorrow as a Canvas submission).

If your partner was unable to make it to today's class session, you will set up and host the repo from your account.
The proposal that you add to the repo and submit a link for on canvas can include up to three ideas for a project. Submitting more than one idea can get you instructor feedback on more than one possible MP4 direction. You can then discuss these possible directions with your partner when they are able to meet. If possible, this meeting should happen before Friday's class.


## Model-View-Controller (MVC) brief intro
We are going to do a brief exercise to introduce the Model View Controller concept briefly today,
so that partners can think about how well this framework might lend itself to one or more of the MP4 ideas brainstormed today.

Model-View-Controller is what is known as a [software design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern).

> In [software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering), a [design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern) is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. A design pattern is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

The Model-View-Controller design pattern (or MVC for short) is an extremely useful design pattern for a number of applications.  The most common places that it shows up are graphical user interfaces and web applications.  Most importantly it is ideally suited to the projects that you all will be doing for this mini-project.  Here is a figure that shows the basic principles of the MVC design pattern.

> * A controller can send commands to the model to update the model's state (e.g. editing a document). It can also send commands to its associated view to change the view's presentation of the model (e.g. by scrolling through a document).
> * A model stores data that is retrieved according to commands from the controller and displayed in the view.
> * A view generates an output presentation to the user based on changes in the model.

This decomposition has a number of extremely nice properties.  At the highest level, the pattern allows for the writing of loosely coupled and highly modular code.  This allows various components to be swapped out with minimal changes to the overall program.
We'll look at an example program using the MVC pattern in a future class (likely Friday).


## A possible MVC for Pac-Man
From the assignment page, we can think through an example of how the classic game, Pac-Man, could be broken into an MVC framework.

Here are the classes and the functions that you might use to implement a Pac-Man clone:

* `Model`: encodes the overall game state of the Pac-Man game (including level, position of pellets, position of Pac-Man and ghosts, etc.)
  * Provides an interface to the Controller to respond appropriately to user commands
  * Handles collisions between Pac-Man and ghosts as well as Pac-Man and small and large pellets
* `PacMan`: represents the player's avatar in the game (a part of the model)
  * Provides an interface to respond to player actions as communicated by the controller (e.g. Pac-Man's next move)
* `Ghost`: represents a ghost in the game (a part of the model)
* `Small pellet`: represents a small pellet in the game (a part of the model)
* `Large pellet`: represents a large pellet in the game (a part of the model)
* `Controller`: handles commands from the user and manipulates the model appropriately
* `PyGameView`: draws the game state encoded by the Model to a pygame window

There are many ways to implement Model-View-Controller, so this is not the
only way to operationalize Model-View-Controller in the context of Pac-Man.
Remember, this is not the only way to structure your object-oriented design (code that uses classes),
but we hope it will be helpful at least as a jumping off point.


## Other possible MVCs
With your partner, revisit one of the project ideas that you discussed. Try to think about what a model of that project might contain.
What would be some of the controls in a controller class? The teaching team will be available throughout the studio time to ask questions about this.


## Git merge conflicts
Today is a great day to sharpen your understanding of how working on code with someone else in the same repo can bring you great joy and great pain. Below, you'll find exercises and examples that help you prepare to avoid or resolve situations that arise when partner pushes modifications to the same file.

When this happens, you need to go through a process to decide how to blend these changes together into a single new version.
Read about [resolving merge conflicts](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line/).

### Exercise: resolving merge conflicts
Let's create a merge conflict so we can practice resolving it.
Follow along with these commands and try it yourself.
We're going to do everything locally, but you can imagine that `repo1` and `repo2` belong to you and your partner on separate machines - everything works the same way.

```bash

# Create new Git repository and commit a file
$ mkdir repo1
$ cd repo1/
$ git init
$ echo -e "Knock knock\nWho's there?" > joke.txt
$ git add joke.txt
$ git commit -m "Add joke setup"

# Clone the repo (simulating a partner)
$ cd ..
$ git clone repo1/ repo2
$ cd repo2

# Make a change in both repos simultaneously (merge conflict)
$ cd ../repo1/
$ echo "Interrupting cow" >> joke.txt
$ git commit -a -m "Cows are always funny"
$ cd ../repo2/
$ echo "Banana" >> joke.txt
$ git commit -a -m "Fruit-based jokes are the best"
```

So now we've got a merge conflict brewing.
Two copies of the repository started from the same commit (the joke setup) but made diverging changes.
Let's see what that looks like, and how to resolve it:

```bash
# From within repo2:
$ git pull origin master
remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
From /home/ben/merge_example/repo1
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
   b056309..2d02106  master     -> origin/master
Auto-merging joke.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in joke.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

Here Git is attempting to merge the two repository contents automatically for you.
Many times it can do so successfully (e.g. if you have each changed different files, it will merge by creating a commit that has both of your changes).
But in this case, we've edited the same part of the same file, so a choice must be made by a human about what should stay and what should go.

At this point, the contents of `joke.txt` in `repo2` look like this:

```
Knock knock
Who's there?
<<<<<<< HEAD
Banana
=======
Interrupting cow
>>>>>>> 2d0210609e38d9f38bb48d8a77fbf57c3d05d15c
```

Git has inserted these markers around the two choices that need to be resolved.
We fix the merge conflict by choosing one of the options, removing the other option and the marker lines (`<<...`, `==...`, and `>>...`), and then committing the file.

You can use any text editor you like to do this, but Atom is particularly nice since it is aware of how git works (you can actually do everything including writing commit messages within Atom, feel free to explore on your own). If you open the conflicted file in Atom, it presents you with buttons like this:

![]({% link images/notes/day13/Atom_merge.png %})

Clicking one of them automatically performs the edits described above. With those changes made and saved, the last step is to commit the merge:

```bash
$ git add joke.txt
$ git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict (cows rule)"
```

At this point the merge conflict is resolved in `repo2`. In your actual workflow you would then want to push the merge resolution commit to a shared location, so that `repo1` can pull it and both partners can work from a common history again.

So: merge conflicts are nothing to be afraid of, but they certainly are annoying.
Some concrete suggestions for avoiding merge conflicts
 - Pull first before you start each work session, to make sure you have the latest version of everyone's work to build on.
 - Avoid working on same file (and especially the same section of a file) simultaneously. Organizing your code into modules as we read about in [Chapter 14.9](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2015.html#sec173) can help with this.
 - Commit/push/pull updates frequently, so there's less opportunity for major divergence.


## Going Beyond: Git branches

What is the "master" in `git push origin master`? It's the name of a [branch](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/git-checkout)!

Developers often use branches to work on a new feature (without halting ongoing development on the master branch). Then once the feature is complete and tested, they can merge it back into master.

To see this visually, work through the first three levels of "[Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)"
