Studio Time for Day 23 - Analysis of Algorithms continued
 - interacting with instructors is optional, but encouraged

## For all students (both breadth and depth)
  * One of the content areas of SoftDes that we normally cover in a class session is: Analysis of Algorithms. In this page, we are providing links to some of the videos and web resources that help visualize what (sorting and searching) algorithms do).
    * An animation of different sorting algorithm styles working on different starting sets is [here](https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms)
    * A colorful visualization of algorithm execution is [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/voutF )
    * This YouTube user posts videos that visualize how many operations different searching or sorting algorithms take - and they showcase dances of different cultures in the process, shown [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/AlgoRythmics)

If you’d like to understand this topic, you can follow the steps below at any time, and try to join Friday's class session if you want to talk about the concepts. You can ask questions about how you might go about scrutinizing algorithms in your (or others’) code.

  * Step 1: watch this video about analysis of algorithms using Big-O notation (5 min)
    * [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeXb8JA4kok)
  * Step 2: start my response video about human impact (15 min)
    * [SoftDes response video](https://youtu.be/APGkL9_bSrg)
  * Step 3: when prompted in the second video, read these articles and resume the video

## Specifically for depth students
  * Make your project page a github page using your depth project response
    * follow [instructions](https://pages.github.com/) and select "Project site"
      * you'll end up with your code in a private repo, but your project page will be public
  * Write up your [Code Review Framing submission](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1804687/assignments/13970622) by Tuesday 4/21 10PM
      * Instructors will use these to prepare for your code review this Friday 4/24
  * We plan to use the same schedule for code reviews that we did for Architecture reviews
    * Please see below and let us know by Wed whether this is a problem and we will make necessary adjustments
    * 11:00-11:10 Nathan, Adi
    * 11:10-11:20 Regan, Jason
    * 11:20-11:30 Jonas, Kelly, Jasper
    * 11:30-11:40 Alex Butler, Declan Ketchum
    * 11:40-11:50 Sam, Hazel
    * 11:50-12:00 Oscar De La Garza, Nabih
    * 12:00-12:10 Jackie Zeng, Rohil Agarwal
    * 12:10-12:20 Patrick, Tolu
    * 12:20-12:30 Kate, Rishita, Prisha
  * Instructors will do a cursory review of your code before you session, based on where you tell us to look. We will bring questions we have, suggestions, and clarifications to the review on Friday. Should we need more time to review based on our discussion, we’ll leave comments on the Canvas Code Review assignment - with links that point to parts of your code if necessary.


## For Breadth
  * The assignment:
    * Work on the [worksheet 3 Assignment](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1804687/assignments/14719469) due Friday 10PM EST
  * We have added new worksheets that you can pull from the ReadingJournal repo, here are all that are available now:
  * [Data science](https://github.com/sd2020spring/ReadingJournal/blob/master/data_science_worksheet.ipynb)
  * [Testing your code](https://github.com/sd2020spring/ReadingJournal/blob/master/testing_worksheet.ipynb)
  * [Classes+Inheritance](https://github.com/sd2020spring/ReadingJournal/blob/master/inheritance.ipynb)
  * [Documenting projects](https://github.com/sd2020spring/ReadingJournal/blob/master/documentation_worksheet.ipynb)
