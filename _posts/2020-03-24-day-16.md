##For anytime - MVC intro
Here is a video that discusses some of the scripts we posted for today's session.
We introduce code that builds up a tic-tac-toe game using an MVC framework.
We're trying a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocAlnF4L88M&feature=youtu.be)
to allow people to pause/rewind etc or watch outside of live class zoom time.

The files [here]({% link files/notes/day16/tic-tac-toe-mvc.py %}) and
[also here]({% link files/notes/day16/tic-tac-toe-mvc-mouse.py %})
will be helpful.


## Today
* Check ins
* Calibrating our virtual teaching tools
* [Text Mining show](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NfbufS7pLlBDdmlahqW2iY2g8HT6YbkQPEnicIFFCKc/edit#slide=id.g4ff183196a_0_0)
* Follow up on the youtube MVC video

## Zoom rooms

We will try whole class zooming and break-out rooms today.
Check-ins might make sense in smaller rooms.
